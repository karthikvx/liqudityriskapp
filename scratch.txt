Overview
Banks utilizing investment services need robust liquidity risk management systems to ensure compliance and avoid financial instability. AWS provides a scalable and secure platform to build such systems, especially when dealing with large datasets. Here's a comprehensive approach: 
1. Data ingestion and storage in S3
Large file processing: Utilize AWS DataSync for efficient transfer of large on-premises files to Amazon S3.
Secure storage: Implement strong S3 security best practices:
Least privilege: Grant only necessary access permissions using IAM roles and restrictive bucket policies.
Encryption: Encrypt data both at rest (using SSE-S3 or SSE-KMS) and in transit (using HTTPS) to protect sensitive information.
Versioning: Enable S3 Versioning to recover from accidental deletions or overwrites.
Object lock: Consider S3 Object Lock for WORM (write-once-read-many) protection on critical data to prevent accidental or malicious alterations.
Public access blocking: Use S3 Block Public Access to prevent unintended public exposure of S3 buckets.
Compliance: For record retention, adhere to regulations like SEC 17 CFR § 240.17a-4 and 18a-6 by storing electronic records under protective measures, potentially using Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP SnapLock features. 
2. ETL (extract, transform, load) and optimization
Data quality checks: Before processing, use AWS Glue to perform data quality checks, including schema verification, duplicate detection, and data integrity checks.
Data lake formation: Build a data lake with S3 for a unified view of data, simplifying regulatory reporting and enabling advanced analytics.
Optimization techniques:
Parallel Processing: Leverage parallel processing frameworks like Spark within AWS services like Amazon EMR to handle large data chunks concurrently, according to LinkedIn.
Data partitioning: Partition data based on criteria like date ranges to improve query performance and reduce scan amounts, notes tapdata.io.
S3 Select: Use S3 Select to retrieve only necessary data from S3 objects, reducing data transfer and processing costs.
Compression: Apply compression techniques like gzip or bzip to reduce data size and storage costs.
Intelligent Tiering: Utilize S3 Intelligent-Tiering to automatically optimize storage costs based on access patterns.
Streamlined processes: Consider micro-batching for processing data in smaller batches, which can reduce memory usage and improve speed. 
3. Risk analysis and compliance
Analytics and machine learning: Use AWS analytics services (e.g., Amazon Athena, Amazon QuickSight) and machine learning (Amazon SageMaker) to extract insights from the processed data, identify risk factors, and generate reports for regulators like those for CCAR, DFAST, CECL, and IFRS9.
Real-time monitoring: Implement real-time monitoring and analytics with tools like Amazon CloudWatch and Amazon Web ServicesAmazon SageMaker to track liquidity positions, covenant compliance, and identify potential risks or anomalies.
Audit and logging: Enable comprehensive logging (AWS CloudTrail and S3 server access logging) for auditing purposes, tracking data access and modifications to demonstrate compliance.
Regulatory reporting: Use the data lake as a single source of truth for generating regulatory reports, potentially utilizing guidance solutions for financial regulatory reporting on AWS, according to Amazon Web Services. 
4. Automation and governance
Lifecycle policies: Implement S3 lifecycle policies to automate data archival and deletion based on regulatory and internal retention requirements.
Automated governance: Use AWS Config and Service Control Policies to enforce security and compliance policies across the AWS environment.
Centralized management: Employ AWS Organizations for centralized management of security and compliance settings across multiple accounts.
Documentation and training: Maintain thorough documentation of configurations, policies, and procedures, along with providing ongoing security training for teams to ensure adherence to best practices. 
By adopting these practices and utilizing AWS's comprehensive suite of services, bank investment services can establish a scalable, secure, and compliant liquidity risk management system capable of handling large files and adapting to evolving regulatory landscapes.
